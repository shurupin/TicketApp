Read more about it\n[here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en#install&zippy=%2Cweb-pages).\n\n## Set up configuration options\n\nThe app uses environment variables because it can be deployed with different accounts\nfor `development`, `qa`, and `production`. This allows you to configure the GTM library differently\nfor each environment.\n\nOpen `.env` file (or create) in the project's root folder and set the\nvariable `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_CONTAINER_ID` with the container ID provided by GTM platform.\n\n```shell\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_CONTAINER_ID=GTM-XXXXXX\n```\n\nIf you do not want to set up environment variables, settings can be applied simply on\nthe `gtmConfig` object found in the `src/config.js` file.\n\n```js\nexport const gtmConfig = {\n  containerId: ''\n};\n```\n","slug":"analytics-configuration","title":"Analytics Configuration"}},"__N_SSG":true}
