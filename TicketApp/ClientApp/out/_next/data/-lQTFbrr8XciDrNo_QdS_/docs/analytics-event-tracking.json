You can extend it to match your business needs. For example, you\nmay need the event name, site section, campaign name, product name, price, process step, etc.\n\n## Page view\n\n```jsx\n// src/pages/login.js\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { gtm } from '../lib/gtm';\n\nconst Page = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    gtm.push({event: 'page_view'});\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      content\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThis example shows you how to track the page view event once the page component gets mounted. It can\nalso be used on mounting virtual pages, such as modals, dialogs, etc.\n\n## Other action\n\n```jsx\n// src/pages/product.js\nimport { gtm } from '../lib/gtm';\n\nconst Page = () => {\n  const handleAddToCart = () => {\n    gtm.push({\n      event: 'add_to_cart',\n      price: '317,65',\n      currency: 'EUR',\n      name: 'Dell Monitor 27\"'\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>Dell Monitor 27\"</div>\n      <div>EUR 317,65</div>\n      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>\n        Add to cart\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAs it can be seen, this example has multiple variables to help you identify the product that was\nadded to cart and its price. These are called conversion variables in most systems, and they are\nused to determine the user behaviour after visiting a specific page or site section. If the user\ndoes not complete the checkout process, you are able to identify most products added to the cart,\nand make decisions based on metrics.\n","slug":"analytics-event-tracking","title":"Event tracking"}},"__N_SSG":true}
